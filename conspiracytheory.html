                <h3>Mikey Biddlestone, the author of this checklist, has detailed some of the characteristics, narratives, associated psychological needs, and damage that conspiracy theories can cause for you and your society.</h3>
                <br><br><hr><br><br>
                <h3>Consequences</h3>
                <p>The checklist you completed included questions that were designed to determine whether the content you encountered was likely to be conspiracy theory. The questions were based on findings from academic literature on  conspiracy beliefs, hoping to provide you with insights into the nature of the information you encountered. Conspiracy theory has become such a concern during the pandemic that efforts have been mobilised to fight the <a href="https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200202-sitrep-13-ncov-v3.pdf" target="_blank">infodemic</a>.<b>So why the concern?</b></p>
                <p>While pre-pandemic literature was already uncovering the many negative implications that conspiracy beliefs can have for the self and society (<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ejsp.2498" target="_blank">social exclusion</a>, <a href="https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/bjop.12018" target="_blank">climate change inaction</a>, <a href="https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/bjop.12018" target="_blank">political apathy</a>, and <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0089177" target="_blank">existential worries</a> ), these findings were extended to anti-vaccination stances and reduced willingness to follow <a href="https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/bjso.12397" target="_blank">social distancing guidelines</a> soon after the inception of the pandemic. Furthermore, evidence suggests that malicious actors may even conspire to <a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/7494689/csis-accuses-russia-china-iran-coronavirus-covid-19-disinformation/" target="_blank">spread certain misinformation</a> in attempts to aggravate societal conditions that can result in <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0306396811425984" target="_blank">political extremism and violence</a>. These dangerous consequences demonstrate how vital it is for us to construct new ways to stop conspiracy theory from spreading. <b>So what research was used to inform the checklist?</b></p>
                <p>The checklist aimed to collect responses about two broad categories: the <b>features or characteristics</b> of the information, and the <b>psychological needs and motives</b> that the information may appeal to. With regards to the features and characteristics, conspiracy theory tend to draw on a <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0233879#sec014" target="_blank">multitude of weak evidential links</a> and rely excessively on simplified <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1065912915621621" target="_blank">distinctions between ‘good vs. evil’ or ‘us vs. them’</a> to make <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5900972/" target="_blank">false connections between events</a> and form <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/0162-895x.00160" target="_blank">grand narratives</a>. Moreover, this type of information tends to make claims that form the components of conspiracy theories – ideas claiming that certain events are <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4612-4618-3_9" target="_blank">secretly orchestrated by small groups of malevolent actors</a> for nefarious gains. Conspiracist claims tend to be <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0963721417718261" target="_blank">impossible to disprove</a>, <a href="https://www.pdcnet.org/ijap/content/ijap_2011_0025_0001_0015_0024" target="_blank">challenge widely supported official narratives</a>, portray a <a href="http://etheses.dur.ac.uk/13147/1/Thesis_Final_Toseland.pdf?DDD32+" target="_blank">belief in the claims as ‘waking up’</a>, often <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00861/full" target="_blank">describe and/or originate from a cult-like ‘ideal’ leader</a>, and accuse non-believers of <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00861/full" target="_blank">blindly following official narratives (“sheeple”)</a>. These factors provide fertile ground for the consequences discussed to harm individuals and society. <b>So why are people drawn to them?</b></p>
                <p>Psychology researchers widely support the notion that conspiracy theories <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0963721417718261" target="_blank">appeal to certain psychological needs</a>. These needs can be broken down into three broad categories: epistemic (the need to understand the world), existential (the need to feel safe and secure), and social (the need to maintain a positive image of the self and ingroup). With regards to epistemic needs, conspiracy theories are particularly appealing to people that rely on ‘gut feelings’ or <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027714001632?via%3Dihub" target="_blank">intuitions</a> to form their understanding about complex issues that they do not necessarily have the <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acp.3301" target="_blank">education</a> or <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886917306323?via%3Dihub" target="_blank">capacity</a> to fully comprehend. These thinking styles also lead individuals to rely on <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/acp.2995" target="_blank">biases</a> to achieve a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886916303221?via%3Dihub" target="_blank">false sense of certainty</a> about the world around them. With regards to existential needs, conspiracy theories also capitalise on and provide explanations for <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12144-013-9165-6" target="_blank">anxieties</a> that people have about events perceived as <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28632335/" target="_blank">threatening</a> or <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886916303221?via%3Dihub" target="_blank">dangerous</a>. With regards to social needs, conspiracy theories can be used by individuals that wish to express <a href="https://econtent.hogrefe.com/doi/full/10.1027/1864-9335/a000306" target="_blank">personal uniqueness from others</a>, and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26511288/" target="_blank">blame outgroups</a> for the <a href="https://ejop.psychopen.eu/index.php/ejop/article/view/1699" target="_blank">negative experiences</a> of one’s ingroup. Aside from the propensity for these needs to lead individuals to form incorrect impressions of the world, they can also <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0963721420917703" target="_blank">exacerbate intergroup tensions</a> and exaggerate the threats we may encounter.</p>
